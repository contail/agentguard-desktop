# Design Philosophy: Invisible Shield

AgentGuard Desktop follows the "Invisible Shield" philosophy.
The app protects AI agents silently in the background without overwhelming users.

## Core Principles

- **Quiet & Calm**: Minimal visual noise. No aggressive reds, flashing alerts, or hacker aesthetics.
- **Trust through Clarity**: Clean whitespace, precise typography, and understated color convey reliability.
- **Action-Oriented**: Each screen has at most 1-2 primary actions. Hide complexity behind "Advanced" toggles.
- **Low Density**: Prefer generous spacing over cramming information. Hero metrics first, details second.

## Color Palette (Monochrome + Soft Accent)

- Background: deep grey (`#18181a`), not pure black
- Card surface: subtle lift (`#222224`) with thin border (`#333336`)
- Text: soft white (`#ededed`) for primary, muted grey (`#a1a1aa` / `#71717a`) for secondary
- Accent: soft blue (`#60a5fa`) for interactive elements
- Success: emerald (`#10b981`), Danger: red (`#ef4444`), Warning: amber (`#f59e0b`)

## Typography

- Font: Inter (400 Regular, 500 Medium, 600 SemiBold, 700 Bold)
- Labels: 500 weight, muted color, with inline description in lighter weight below
- Values/Numbers: 600-700 weight, tabular-nums for alignment

## Empty States

Never show a blank screen with just text. Always provide:
1. A subtle SVG icon
2. A clear title explaining the state
3. A description telling the user what to do next
